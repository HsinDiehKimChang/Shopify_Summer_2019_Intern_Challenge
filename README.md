Task: Build the barebones of an online marketplace.

To do this, build a server side web api that can be used to fetch products either one at a time or all at once.
Every product should have a title, price, and inventory_count.

Querying for all products should support passing an argument to only return products with available inventory. 

Products should be able to be "purchased" which should reduce the inventory by 1. Products with no inventory cannot be purchased.
